Hello. My name is Yulia, I am 30 years old and I am from Ukraine. I came to England with my daughter because there is a war in my country. I am fond of nature and walks in nature, this is my recreation.  I train in the gym in my free time, and I also like to watch interesting historical films and have a little Yorkshire Terrier dog. I am an eyebrow artist by profession, but now I have decided that I need to learn something new for me. I was always interested in tech industry and I feel like now is the best time for me to change careers. I think that Tech industry is very interesting.
